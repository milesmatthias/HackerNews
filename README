This is my first venture with Sencha Touch. It's a simple application that pulls in Hacker News articles using ihackernews.com's API and does a query on Twitter for mentions of @newsycombinator.

I learned by using these resources:

http://www.sencha.com/learn/my-first-sencha-touch-experience/
http://www.sencha.com/learn/intro-to-panels/

Known Issue:
- The list of articles and tweets doesn't allow full scrolling.
	(I'm guessing this is because my layout isn't making the list aware of the docked toolbar.)
